Data Analyst
------------

I am a graduate with a degree in Management and have experience working internationally in Education and Customer care. These have equipped me with vital skills including effective communication, collaborative working, attention to detail, problem solving and data confidentiality in a fast-paced environment. 

I went into data analysis because I am naturally a curious person who loves to solve problems so the prospect of going through data, providing insights and making decisions based on that excites me, plus working with data means that I am not restricted to one industry. 

I have completed a 12-week intensive Data Technician Bootcamp with Just IT to equip me with the necessary sort after skills like Excel, Python, SQL, R and Azure to prepare me for a career in Data Analysis. 
I am passionate about story telling and drawing actionable insights from data and therefore seek a career in Data Analysis with the goal to apply all the skills I have acquired in my training and to hone my technical skills in a professional and challenging environment.
